    "overview": "<p>Ready for a wildlife and adventure filled camping weekend? Lake Perris camping has 167 sites for tent camping and 264 paved RV sites (which have water, electricity, and sink water hookups). There is one hike and bike campsite located by the horseshoe pit, and there are 7 primitive horse camps. The sites are all equipped with a table, fire ring with a grill, and access to piped water. Most plants and animals at Lake Perris are well adapted to the hot, dry environment, so make sure you’re prepared as well. It can get quite warm in the summer and there isn’t too much tree coverage – so bring a canopy if you have one! Or just stay in the lake the whole time… that’s fine too.</p>",

If you want a good-hearted family-bonding sort of experience, undisturbed by the busy world outside of this pristine encapsulation of natural beauty, then pack your kids and fishing poles into the truck and get yourselves over here. We’re sure you’ll love and appreciate your time at this clean (and uncommercialized) part of Roaring River State Park. Did we mention that the campsites are a two minute walk from the river? And that the waters are stocked each night by one of our nation’s premier trout fisheries? Yes, awesome.",

Pawfoot Trail runs alongside the campground for easy access to some awesome hiking, horseback riding, or biking. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf your group is larger than 17 people, be sure to reserve a group campsite in either Hickey Creek or Sycamore Flats group area, which offer 7 group sites total. (Note: Group campsite D in Sycamore Flats is pretty close to the creek, if that’s your thing.) Bringing your horse along? Hermon Equestrian Camping area offers 5 different sites, all relatively close to the creek with site 1 being the most private.\r\n",
